## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, echo=FALSE}

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(reshape2)

name <- c("C1","C3","C5","C7","C10","C13")


block_propagation <- c(10.04, 10.01, 10.01, 10.0, 10.03, 10.10)
ba_without_final <- c(13.16, 13.14, 13.14, 13.15, 13.15, 13.15)
ba_with_final <- c(15.59, 15.61, 15.67, 15.67, 15.69, 15.68)

#concurrency1 <- c(10.04, 13.16, 15.59)
#concurrency3 <- c(10.01, 13.14, 15.61)
#concurrency5 <- c(10.01, 13.14, 15.67)
#concurrency7 <- c(10.0, 13.15, 15.67)
#concurrency10 <- c(10.03, 13.15, 15.69)
#concurrency13 <- c(10.10, 13.13, 15.68)

dataset <- data.frame(name, block_propagation, ba_without_final,  ba_with_final )

molted=melt(dataset,id.vars=c("name"))

head(molted, n=25)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure}

p <- ggplot(molted, aes( name, value))
p + geom_area(aes(colour = variable, fill= variable), position = 'stack') 

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
